# requirements.txt

# This file should list all Python libraries that your project depends on.
# Since the project description does not specify any external libraries and
# the task can be completed with Python's standard library, this file can be left empty.

# However, if you later decide to use any third-party libraries, you should list them here,
# along with their versions. For example:
# numpy==1.19.3
# pandas==1.1.5

# For now, no additional libraries are needed.
