# Code Prompt Generator

## Overview
The Code Prompt Generator is a Python-based tool designed to generate coding prompts for practice or interview preparation. It simulates a cursor-based prompt generation system that moves through a document line by line, generating prompts based on the content of each line.

## Features
- Generates prompts based on the current line in a text document.
- Skips empty lines without generating a prompt.
- Generates a specific prompt for questions and statements.
- Adds a special end prompt when the cursor reaches the end of the document.

## Installation
No additional libraries are required to run this project. It is built using Python's standard library. Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed on your system.

## Usage
To use the Code Prompt Generator, run the `main.py` script. This will use the example document provided in the script to generate and print prompts to the console.

```bash
python main.py
```

## Input Format
The `generate_prompts` function expects a list of strings as input, where each string represents a line in the document.

## Output Format
The function returns a list of strings, where each string is a prompt generated by the cursor.

## Example
```python
document = [
    "What is the meaning of life?", 
    "Life is a journey, not a destination.", 
    "", 
    "To be, or not to be, that is the question.",
    "Some infinities are bigger than other infinities."
]

prompts = generate_prompts(document)
for prompt in prompts:
    print(prompt)
```

## Testing
The `test_prompt_generator.py` script contains unittests for the `generate_prompts` function. Run the following command to execute the tests:

```bash
python -m unittest test_prompt_generator.py
```

## Files
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the Python libraries required for the project (currently empty as no external libraries are needed).
- `prompt_generator.py`: Contains the `generate_prompts` function that generates the prompts.
- `main.py`: An example script that demonstrates how to use the `generate_prompts` function.
- `test_prompt_generator.py`: Contains unittests for the `generate_prompts` function.
- `README.md`: This file, which provides an overview and instructions for the project.

## Constraints
- All strings in the document are made up of printable ASCII characters.
- The document does not contain any lines with more than 1000 characters.
- The document does not contain more than 10^5 lines.
- Time complexity should not exceed O(n).
